    "The data used in this project contain complaints that have been made by consumers regarding financial services and products (e.g. student loans, credit reports, mortgage, etc) in the United States between November 2011 and May 2019. Each of the complaints is marked to belong under one Product Category. This makes the data ideal for supervised learning purposes, with the text (complaint from the consumer) as the **input**, and the category that the complaint belongs to as the **target** variable.\n",
