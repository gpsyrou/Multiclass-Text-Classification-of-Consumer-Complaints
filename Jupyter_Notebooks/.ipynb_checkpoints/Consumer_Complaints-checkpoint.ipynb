    "The data used in this project contain complaints that have been made by consumers regarding financial services and products (e.g. student loans, credit reports, mortgage, etc) in the United States between November 2011 and May 2019. Each of the complaints is marked to belong under one Product Category. This makes the data ideal for supervised learning purposes, with the text (complaint from the consumer) as the **input**, and the category that the complaint belongs to as the **target** variable.\n",

    "After this small introduction, we can move to the main part of the project. At the beggining we will load the dataset into Python, perform some data cleaning and continue with the exploratory data analysis part, so that we can get a better understanding of the dataset. After we make sure that we understand the data, we will proceed to the modeling part where we will try different types of classification algorithms and compare their performance on predicting to which class/category each complaint should fall into."
