# Multiclass-Text-Classification-on-Consumer-Complaints

Project Description:

The data used in this project contain complaints that have been made by consumers regarding financial services and products (e.g. Student loans, credit reports, etc) in the US between November 2011 and May 2019.
Each of the complaints is marked to belong under one Product Category. This makes the data ideal for supervised learning purposes, with
the text (complaint) as the input, and the category that the complaint belongs to as the target variable.
