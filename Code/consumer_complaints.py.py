# Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Main purpose of this project is to use the 'Consumer complaint narrative'
# column, in order to predict to which category (defined by 'Product' column)
# the complaint belongs to.

# Identify the amount of times that each Category (Product) is present in our
# dataset. We have no missing values for this column, so no imputation method
# is necessary.

# reports' instead of 'Mortgage' that was first when we were using the whole
