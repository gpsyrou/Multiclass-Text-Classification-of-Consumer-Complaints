# Part 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

# Main purpose of this project is to use the 'Consumer complaint narrative'
# column, in order to predict to which category (defined by 'Product' column)
# the complaint belongs to.

# Identify the amount of times that each Category (Product) is present in our
# dataset. We have no missing values for this column, so no imputation method
# is necessary.

# from the consumer regarding the complaint that they are submitting)

# Its interesting to see that the category with the most complaints is now
# the 'Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer
# reports' instead of 'Mortgage' that was first when we were using the whole
# dataset.

# Part 2. Preprocessing

# In order to build our classification model, we will need only the
# 'Consumer complaint narrative' column as the predictor  variable
#  and 'Product' as the target variable

# We can observe that our dataset it's highly imbalanced regarding the
# distribution of the product categories. Most of the product are falling under
# the credit reporting, debit collection and mortgage categories. Imbalanced 
# datasets can usually be a major issue as they can lead to misleading results.
# This is because the algorithm will seem to be predicting 'correctly' and 
# achieving high accuracy scores, while this will be due to the fact that its
# only predicting correctly the majority class.
