# Most of the algorithms do not work well when they have to deal with text data
# in their raw form. To solve this issue we will work with some techniques such
# like the bag of words and TF-IDF.

# Bag of words refers to the process of creating a vector of word counts of
# a document (which in our case refers to the complaints made by the consumers)
# In simple words, its the number that each word appears in a document. Please
# have in mind that Bag of Words does not take into consideration the order of
# the words neither any grammatical rules.

# TF-IDF is being used to get an understanding of how relevant a word is on a 
# document. Words that appear many times in one document are getting higher
# significance for that document if they do not appear in other documents. On
# the other hand, common words like 'and' and 'the' are usually common in all
# documents and therefore they do not provide much information.
